            <p class="pp" id="welcome"><a class="link3">Three Body Problem - Qixin Liu</a></p>
            <p class="pp2">solid book involved with science and physics. very enjoyable but a little hard to read as well. &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;</p>

            <p class="pp">Can't Hurt Me - David Goggins</p>
            <p class="pp2">changed how i viewed challenges and hardships. gave me a completely new outlook on life. highly recommend &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>

            <p class="pp">Foundation - Isaac Asimov</p>
            <p class="pp2">difficult read, but an interesting take on the future and how it relies on mostly mathematics. studied this book recently for school and it provoked some truly deep discussion.
                wouldn't read again, but i do recommend it. &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;</p>

            <p class="pp">Annihilation - Jeff VanderMeer</p>
            <p class="pp2">short but action-packed read. VanderMeer does a good job of describing the surroundings and immersing the reader in the situation, making each reveal of the environment that much scarier. &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;</p>
            
            <p class="pp">A Psalm for the Wild-Built - Becky Chambers</p>
            <p class="pp2">short and easy read, it's a book about the future of mankind and near-sentient robots. heartwarming story between a lost person finding themselves and a robot needing answers. I would recommend it as a short intermediary book. &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;</p>

            <p class="pp">Cryptology - Albrecht Beutelspacher</p>
            <p class="pp2">mostly short read, it is a very complex book covering mostly complex ideas about codes, cryptology, and ciphers. I would recommend reading it only if you are really into codebreaking and that matter. &#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;</p>
            
            <p class="pp">Surrounded by Idiots - Thomas Erikson</p>
            <p class="pp2">interesting read and take on the personalities of people and how to categorize them. now that i've read this book, i am constantly classifying myself into roles as well as my peers. would recommend. &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;</p>

            <p class="pp">Interior Chinatown - Charles Yu</p>
            <p class="pp2">an interesting take on the status of Chinese/Asian Americans as a permanent outsider, never to be seen as American. good pacing, fast read, and a very unique read. i originally picked up this book because the TV series was great. this book definitely did not disappoint. would recommend. &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;</p>
